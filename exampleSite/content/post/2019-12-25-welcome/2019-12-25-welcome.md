Welcome!

I'm a data scientist fresh out of university, and I plan to use this site my document my forays into data analysis and visualizations.  I'm a sports junkie, so most of my posts will probably involve sports-related datasets, but I'll try to find interesting datasets pertaining to other fields as well.

I'll leave you with the output of one of my school projects -- I implemented "Neural Style Transfer" using Tensorflow, and transferred the style from Van Gogh's 'Starry Night' onto an image of my wife and I.
